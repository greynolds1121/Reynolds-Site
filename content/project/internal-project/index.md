## Personal Website
I built this website entirely in RStudio, using the [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) package. </br>

If you want to build a website like this, I recommend checking out Alison Hill's [blog](https://www.apreshill.com/blog/2020-12-new-year-new-blogdown/) and Jennifer Sloane's [youtube series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xbxXR_Iu5Y).
