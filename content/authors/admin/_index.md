My name is Gabriel Reynolds (he/him). I’m currently a student of environmental studies, community and global health, and data science at Macalester College. My research interests include quantitative public health, climate justice, and infectious disease epidemiology. 

I was born and raised in St. Paul, Minnesota and have been happy to continue calling the Twin Cities my home throughout college. Looking to the future, I am determined to carve out a career in quantitative public health. Specifically, I am hoping to leverage my data analysis, GIS, and analytical thinking skills to develop better public health practices and interventions that are rooted in justice and sustainability. 

I am hard working, detail oriented, and bring a passion for learning. Combined with strong communication skills, experience with teamwork and independent projects, and skills in qualitative and quantitative research, I hope to activate and mobilize teams around a vision.
